# SecAct: Secreted Protein Activity Inference <img src="man/figures/sticker.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

SecAct is an R package designed for inferring the intercellular
signaling activity of secreted proteins from gene expression profiles.
Users can input multiple modalities of expression data, including
spatial, single-cell, or bulk transcriptomics data. The outputs are the
inferred signaling activities of \>1,000 secreted proteins for each
spatial spot, individual cell, or sample, depending on the input data
type. Based on the inferred activities, SecAct provides multiple
downstream application modules. For spatial data, SecAct can infer the
signaling pattern and signaling velocity for secreted proteins. For
single-cell data, SecAct can infer the intercellular communication
network and signaling flow from source cells to receiver cells. For bulk
data, SecAct can infer secreted protein risk scores for a large cohort
linked to clinical data, and can infer secreted protein activities that
are differentially regulated between two phenotypes. These
functionalities and terms are explained more formally in the following
tutorials.

## Installation

To install `SecAct` R package, we recommend using `devtools`:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("data2intelligence/SecAct")
```

Or user can install `SecAct` R package from the source code. Click
<a href="https://api.github.com/repos/data2intelligence/SecAct/tarball/HEAD" target="_blank">here</a>
to download it.

``` r
# install SecAct dependencies
remotes::install_deps("Path_to_the_source_code", force = TRUE)

# install SecAct R package
install.packages("Path_to_the_source_code", repos = NULL, type="source")
```

The R package has been installed successfully on Operating Systems:

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.10 (Ootpa)
- macOS Sequoia 15.3.1

##### Alternative installation options:

1.  If you are not familiar with R, you can use the
    <img src="vignettes/img/Python-logo.png" width="2%" style="border:none" />
    Python version of SecAct available
    <a href="https://github.com/data2intelligence/SecActpy" target="_blank">here</a>.

2.  If you prefer not to install SecAct locally, we provide a Docker
    image for both the R and Python versions:

<!-- -->

    # Pull the Docker image.
    docker pull psychemistz/secactpy:with-r

3.  An online server is also available
    <a href="https://appshare.cancer.gov/SecAct/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Please note that it currently supports only the basic activity
    inference function and is limited to datasets with fewer than 10
    samples.

## Dependencies

- R version \>= 4.2.0.
- R packages: Matrix, ggplot2, reshape2, patchwork, NMF, akima,
  gganimate, metap, circlize, ComplexHeatmap, ggalluvial, networkD3,
  survival, survminer.
- Optional accelerator (see below):
  [FlashReg](https://github.com/data2intelligence/FlashReg) (one
  package, both CPU and GPU paths; GSL is required, NVIDIA CUDA
  Toolkit is optional).
- Optional `rhdf5` for HDF5 streaming of large inputs/outputs in batch
  mode.

## Accelerators and batch mode

The default ridge + permutation kernel is pure R with no compiled
dependencies — SecAct installs and runs anywhere R runs. For large
datasets, install
[FlashReg](https://github.com/data2intelligence/FlashReg) to enable
the C+OpenMP CPU backend (and optionally the CUDA GPU backend):

- `FlashReg::ridge(backend = "omp")` — multi-threaded CPU (GSL +
  OpenMP)
- `FlashReg::ridge(backend = "cuda_native")` — NVIDIA GPU (CUDA),
  built only when nvcc is present at install time

With FlashReg installed,
`SecAct.activity.inference(..., backend = "auto")` (the default) picks
GPU \> CPU-fast \> pure-R automatically — FlashReg detects CUDA
availability at runtime. At `rng_method = "mt19937"` (default) and
`ncores = 1`, output is bit-identical across all three backends.

For memory-constrained workflows, set `batch_size` to process samples
in column-batches:

``` r
# Memory-bounded inference on 100k samples
res <- SecAct.activity.inference(inputProfile = Y_large,
                                 is.differential = TRUE,
                                 batch_size = 5000)

# Stream results to HDF5 when even the result matrices don't fit in RAM
SecAct.activity.inference(inputProfile = Y_large,
                          is.differential = TRUE,
                          batch_size = 5000,
                          output_h5 = "results.h5",
                          is.group.sig = FALSE)
```

## Example

``` r
library(SecAct)

dataPath <- file.path(system.file(package = "SecAct"), "extdata/")
expr.diff <- read.table(paste0(dataPath, "Ly86-Fc_vs_Vehicle_logFC.txt"))

# infer activity; ~2 mins
res <- SecAct.activity.inference(inputProfile=expr.diff, is.differential=TRUE) 

head(res$zscore)
```
